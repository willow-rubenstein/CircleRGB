# CircleRGB - A Program by Me!

# How to run on windows:
- Go to releases
- Install latest release binary (includes all dependencies)
> Note: You have to disable the firewall for OpenRGB so it can connect to the program, and disable any other keyboard software you have open (i.e. Logitech G-Hub for Logitech keyboards, etc. for the program to work. Additionally, config.json is created for you if it is not found.

## How to edit config.json:
- Look up the RGB values for the colors you'd like to use per each different hit type
- Replace the values in the list with those values of each color.
- Relaunch the app.

# How to homebrew:
- Install Python >= 3.10 if you do not have it already
- Install requirements.txt via pip
- Install [OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org)
- Install [gosumemory](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory) or build for your platform
- In order to run the program, you must have gosumemory, gosumemory, and osu! running at the same time.

## If your keyboard does not work with OpenRGB, please put an issue request in [Issues](https://github.com/willow-rubenstein/CircleRGB/issues) with a link to your keyboard, and I will look at manually supporting it if possible.
